BlogMLToMarkdown
================

A c# command line tool for transforming a Blog ML document to markdown documents for Jekyll. It uses pandoc for transforming HTML into Markdown. It's not perfect but you will get a good looking markdown document with few issues (specially for code snippets). This tool does not export comments.
